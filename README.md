## Purpose
This project contains an GO api client to connect to the Focustronic Alkatronic api. 
You can authenticate with your own credentials and retrieve the test results for your devices. 
Then you can use the data for other use cases such as monitoring, graphing, and alerting.

## Examples

1. Set credentials in your shell:
```
export ALKATRONIC_USERNAME="user here"
export ALKATRONIC_PASSWORD="password here"
```
